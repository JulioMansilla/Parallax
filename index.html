        <p>In a world full of magic, there was a nomad castle. With steam powered mechanical legs the abomination roamed the planes, searching to kill its hunger.</p>

        <p>What an interesting flame, not only does he talk but he is also quiet the host. Would you like some hot tea? maybe a full English breakfast? Oh poor thing when was the last time you ate? When was the last time I ate...</p>

        <h2>As the question leaves his fiery mouth</h2>
        <p>His voice and appearance change, no longer do you see a wonderful little flame. Calsifire bulks up, no longer hiding his intentions. What follows is just as horrible as you are imagining, the flames engulf everything in his path and there is only the smell of burnt flesh and fat. The flames eventually reside, and Calsifire talks to the astonished Victim. From this day on, my curse will follow you and your bacon will <strong>ALWAYS BURN.</strong>
